​
## Usage 
​
In order to ensure this code can be viewed correctly, it must be viewed in a web browser, ideally Google Chrome as it has the best compatibility. You can do this using the following link: https://kddayhoff.github.io/Day-Planner/. Enter in items for your daily schedule, hit "save" and the items will be stored to the page. The colors shift depending on the time of day, indicating time that passed, the current hour, and future hours.

## Credits
​
All the classmates of VU Coding Bootcamp, the TA's Terrance Mahnken, Pete Wanca, and the instructor Alec Downs. Seriously though.

Feel free to make this better. It's like Thoreau's <i>Walden</i>, nothing is original. Take an axe for example, you're not going to reinvent the axe. However, you can always leave it sharper than when you found it.
